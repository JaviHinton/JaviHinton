- 👋 Hi, I’m @JaviHtn
- 👀 I’m interested in Cloud and Automation technologies, but still very much new to this all!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python programming having finished my LPI Linux Essentials exam
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can get my grubby little hands on, as long as its not too advanced (yet!)
- 📫 I can be reached on javierh@pm.me
